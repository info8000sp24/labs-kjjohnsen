## Completion
I completed all parts of this lab.
## Reflection
Reviewing the solution, I realized a few things.  I made a last second change and didn't check my work!  So, my program ran with an error.  I fixed that in my code. I also added a way to ignore new lines when character counting, so the behavior would be consistent across platforms!  Otherwise, I think I understand how the basic execution and debugging of python code works now.
