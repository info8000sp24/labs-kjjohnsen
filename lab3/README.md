# Lab 3
## Completion
I completed all parts of this lab.  I decided to use Classes heavily in part 1, and then pandas and seaborn heavily in part 2.  Most of this is for illustrative purposes. 

Your reflection should really consider if the lab's solution is worthwhile relative to what you did.  Consider the relative efficiencies/inefficiencies there may be between the solutions.
